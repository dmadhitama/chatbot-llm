Fig. 4\\ndemonstrates the meaningful change in lung can-\\ncer development and outcomes by gender in the\\nlast 50 years. Although smoking history and olderage remain the predominant risk factors for lung\\ncancer development, current estimates are that10% to 20% of patients who develop lung cancerare never smokers,\\n21and lung cancer incidence in\\nwomen is approaching that in men. Also, although\\nthe overall trend in the United States is towardfewer lung cancer deaths and longer survival,\\nmany groups struggle with more lung cancer\\ncases and worsening outcomes. Several demo-graphic factors have been identified that influence\\nlung cancer development and outcomes, including\\ngender, age, race, geography, and socioeconomicstatus (SES).\\nGender\\nChristina R. MacRosty and M. Patricia Rivera’s\\narticle, “ Lung Cancer in Women: A Modern\\nEpidemic ,” in this issue, of this Clinics issue is\\ndedicated to lung cancer in women. Owing to\\nthe significant changes in lung cancer epidemi-\\nology, we mention 3 points here. First, lung can-cer incidence and mortality are consistently\\nlower in women compared with men (see\\nFig. 4 ), although the gender “gap” is narrowing\\nowing to both values falling more rapidly in\\nmen. If current trends continue, modeling studies\\nsuggest that the number of lung cancer deaths inwomen will exceed those in men in 2045.\\n16Sec-\\nond, the demographics of women diagnosed\\nwith lung cancer are different than those in\\nmen. Specifically, women tend to be diagnosedwith lung cancer at a younger age, are more\\nlikely to be nonsmokers, and are more likely to\\nbe diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma.\\n22Finally,\\nwomen have improved lung cancer survival\\nacross all disease stages than men.23In combi-\\nnation, these findings support unique biologicaland genetic mechanisms of lung cancerbetween men and women.
